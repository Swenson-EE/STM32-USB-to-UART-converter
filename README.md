# STM32-USB-to-UART-converter
This project involved designed and implementing a USB to UART cable bridge using a microcontroller with native USB support. The goal was to create a reliable interface for connecting a USB-enabled device (such as a PC) to a UART-based peripherial. I selected the STM32F103 -- specifically, the STM32F103RCT6 -- for its integrated USB and UART capabilities. 

This project includes PCB design, firmware written in C/C++, and other features that aid the support of the device.
