# UART Protocol
UART -- Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter -- is a very common device-to-device communication protocol. During serial communication, data is transferred bit-by-bit using a single line. Which can be extended to two lines for two-way communication.

The two signals used in UART devices are:
- TX (Transmitter)
- RX (Receiver)

UART has many different configurations within operating such as: speed, data frame, parity bits, and stop bits.

### Start bit
UART is typically held high when not transmitting data. To start a transmission, the transmitting UART line pulls the TX line from high to low for 1 clock cycle. The receiving UART detects this high to low transition and can begin reading the data frame at the agreed upon baud rate.

### Data frame
The data frame is the actual data being transferred. This can be 5 bits to 8 bits long if parity is used, and if parity is not used, then the data frame can be 9 bits long. Data is typically sent with the least significant bit (LSB) first.

### Parity
Parity is the evenness or oddness of the number. This is a way to tell if any data changed during transmittion. The number of bits with a value of 1 are counted and is checked with the parity bit. If the parity bit matches the data, then the uart transmission is likely free of errors. 

### Stop bits
At the end of the data packet, the sending UART drives the TX line from low to high for 1 or 2 bits.
